# Insider Champions League

A football league simulation project based on Premier League rules. This app allows you to simulate weekly matches or an entire season, view a live league table, and calculate each team's probability of winning the championship.

At the beginning you can run migrations, fixturesto create team. After that I've prepered command to create schedule of games 'league:generate-season' and command for initailization of table view 'app:init-standings', both of them are needed to fine working of app.

Hope everything goes smoothly with testing like it did in my case! If anything wrong please let me know!
